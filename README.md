**NOTE : This is pre-alpha software.**

V UI is a cross-platform UI toolkit written in [the V programming language](https://github.com/vlang/v)
for Windows, macOS, Linux, and soon Android, iOS and the web (JS/WASM). V UI
uses native widgets on Windows and macOS, on all other platforms the widgets
are drawn by V UI.  Right now only the non-native widgets are available.

This is a very early version of the library, lots of features are missing
(layouts, certain widgets, etc), lots of things will change.

There will be a declarative version of the API with hot reloading, similar to SwiftUI and Flutter.

On Linux, V UI will be a full-featured lightweight alternative to GTK and Qt.

### Dependencies

Binaries built with V UI will have no dependencies.

To develop V UI apps, you need to install [V](https://github.com/vlang/v#installing-v-from-source),
`glfw` and `freetype`. `glfw` dependency will soon be removed.

```markdown
macOS:
brew install glfw freetype

Debian/Ubuntu:
sudo apt install libglfw3 libglfw3-dev libfreetype6-dev

Arch/Manjaro:
sudo pacman -S glfw-x11 freetype2

Fedora:
sudo dnf install glfw glfw-devel freetype-devel

Windows:
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ubawurinna/freetype-windows-binaries [path to v repo]/thirdparty/freetype/
```

### License

V UI is licensed under GPL3. A commercial license will be available.
Open-source projects will have access to the commercial license for free. Every
single feature will be open-sourced right away and available under both
licenses. At some point in the future the library will be relicensed under MIT.
