**This is pre-alpha software.**

V UI is a cross-platform UI toolkit written in [the V programming language](https://github.com/vlang/v)
for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and soon iOS and the web (JS/WASM). V UI
uses native widgets on Windows and macOS, on all other platforms the widgets
are drawn by V UI. Right now only the non-native widgets are available.

This is a very early version of the library, lots of features are missing, lots of things will change.

The API is declarative, and there will be hot reloading, similar to SwiftUI and Flutter.

On Linux, V UI will be a full-featured lightweight alternative to GTK and Qt.

[0.1 roadmap](https://github.com/vlang/ui/issues/31)

Discord: [`#v-ui` channel](https://discord.gg/vlang)

Documentation will be available soon. In the meantime use the examples as the documentation. The framework is very simple and straightforward.

### Dependencies

Binaries built with V UI will have no dependencies.

To develop V UI apps, you need to install [V](https://github.com/vlang/v#installing-v-from-source). This takes a couple of seconds.

On some Linux distros you also need a few development dependencies:
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libxi-dev libxcursor-dev mesa-common-dev`
- Fedora: `sudo dnf install libXi-devel libXcursor-devel mesa-libGL-devel`

On ChromeOS Linux/Crostini, install the Debian dependencies listed above followed by this:
- `sudo apt install freeglut3-dev` ([see details](https://github.com/vlang/ui/issues/316))

### License

V UI is licensed under GPL3. A commercial license will be available.
Open-source projects will have access to the commercial license for free. Every
single feature will be open-sourced right away and available under both
licenses. At some point in the future the library will be relicensed under MIT.

### Contributing

After the first contribution you will be asked to agree to a CLA, declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution.
